				<p> Welcome to <p class="ms">Mustard Sandwich</p>, the greatest arcade on the Internet!* Are you looking for an aggregate of fun and popular HTML5 games (no Adobe Flash Player required)? Or maybe you're interested in one of our exciting original games like <a href="/games/dodgeball">Dodgeball</a> or <a href="/games/wonderparc-2">Wonderparc 2: The Real Deal</a>? Perhaps you were looking for <a href="/recipe">a recipe for a mustard sandwich</a> and found us on the fourth page of Google? Regardless, you've come to the right place.</p>
				<h2> NEWS </h2>
				<p><b> 02-08-17 </b></p>
				<p> Renovations have begun on the Games page! Each game will eventually have a thumbnail and links with useful information about the game. In addition, individual games will take up less real estate on the page, allowing us more freedom as the arcade expands. </p>
