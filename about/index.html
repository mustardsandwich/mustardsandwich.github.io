				<p> Thanks you for visiting mustardgame.info a website doing honor to one of the most iconic and popular game 'Wonderparc' and game series the world has ever knowned, Mr William Tippins is the creator and designer of this popular game when he worked for free while developing Wonder Park Game. It's most probably your parents played wonderparc in their childhood to inmerse themselves in a world of wonderful graphics, realistic jump movements, feeding strategically located fish and some out of this world minigames, oh yeah, and his forever best friends the turtle. </p>
