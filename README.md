# Mustard Sandwich
Mustard Sandwich (http://mustardgame.info/) is a website where you can play free online games. Because I want most of my video game projects to be open source and browser-based, this site will serve as a place to play these games. Additionally, older game development projects of mine that are not necessarily browser-based will be available for download on this website.

## Wonderparc 2
Wonderparc 2 is the first browser-based game I have developed. Written in Javascript with the Phaser engine, it was created as a sequel to my game Wonderparc, which was a final exam project for a game development class. 

Wonderparc 1 was developed in Python using the Pygame engine, which is somewhat limited in its functionality. The original concept of Wonderparc was more freeform and expansive, which made it disappointing that the final product was really just a collection of four minigames. Additionally, it was restrained by its simplicity and level of difficulty, as it was designed with the purpose of rehabilitating hospitalized children to use a keyboard. 

The purpose of Wonderparc 2 is to exceed the first game in both scope and entertainment. While the first game was a program meant for rehabilitation, this one fills a rather different niche: it is meant to emulate classic Flash browser-based games that can be played for free and offer a mindless source of entertainment.

Wonderparc 2 will not be a random assortment of simple minigames but rather a cohesive collection, bound together by an overworld. Rather than a game themed after a marine park like SeaWorld, I want the player to feel as if they are actually managing a park and training the animals. To this end, there will be a Story Mode where the player is in charge of running Wonderparc, and an Arcade Mode (with a series of highscore tables) where animal-specific minigames can be played.

The entirety of the game will be navigable using only the mouse. The design philosophy behind this is simple. You don't really need more than a mouse pointer or even a trackpad to play a browser-based game of Wonderparc 2's caliber. More importantly, clacking away at the keyboard while in the middle of class or work can make it obvious that you're playing a game. Wonderparc 2 is designed such that one can safely and stealthily play it in their browser during personal downtime.
